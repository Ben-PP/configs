# VSCode configs

Here are my custom configs for vscode. Mostly defaults but I have added vim like keybindings for navigation.

## Extensions

Extensions in use are listed in the `extensions.txt` file and can be installed with `./install-extensions.sh extensions.txt`. You might need to set the execution bit with `chmod +x install-extensions.sh`.
